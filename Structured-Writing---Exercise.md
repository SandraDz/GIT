# Using the Calculator App

In this topic, you can find information about the calculator app. This application is the best way for you to perform arithmetical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division of numbers.

To sum up two numbers you must first start the application. Enter the first number, then press the + button. You can also subtract numbers - press the - button in this case.

To conclude the operation, enter the second number and press the = button.
According to Wikipedia, the history of arithmetic includes the period from the emergence of counting before the formal definition of numbers and arithmetic operations over them by means of a system of axioms. Arithmetic — the science of numbers, their properties, and their relations — is one of the main mathematical sciences. It is closely connected with algebra and the theory of numbers.

The application allows you to apply all that knowledge in one! Multiply the numbers the same way you did with the subtraction process. But remember, you must choose the * button to complete the process! Alternatively, use the / button to divide numbers, as you desire.

The results you get in the end are the perfectly calculated numbers that you needed! 

This is such a great and simple to use software!
